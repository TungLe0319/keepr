aria-labels and proper titles

On private vault page while logged in, refresh on page throws private vault error.

while on vault page, setting vaultedKeep as active still raises view count even though im not the owner


navbar collapse spillage

get vkeeps by vault Id repository double check the count

Should user be able to add one keep to many of their own vaults and THEN from the vault page/ vaulted Keep modal remove it or
only have one single keep


create modal needs to say create keep
create vault form dark mode
private vaults on account page have offset height
deleteVaultKeep needs fixing
